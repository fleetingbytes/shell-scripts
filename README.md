# Shell Scripts

Collection of shell scripts I use on my machines. I wanted to write them for a particular chore and I felt like honing my POSIX-sh skills rather than coding it in Python.

# Idea

These scripts were created with the Clean Code principles in mind, with special focus on readability. Most scripts, before they do anything, source some constants or function definitions from a file in this repository's `lib` directory and define the variables which the functions rely on.

# Use

- clone this repository
- execute scripts from the local clone of this repository
- put softlinks to your PATH for convenience
